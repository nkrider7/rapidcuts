		  <div class="desc">Here comes the real-time security engineer, bug bounty or Pentesting is a concept where you need to penetrate a website or applications in simple words finding bugs or flaws in a website, as a fresher role in the cyber domain, you will apply as a penetration tester or cyber security analyst. Mastering bug bounty will get a high paid job in the cyber security domain. And guess what you can start to earn as a passive income from bug bounty also. When I learnt, I parallelly learnt CEH and Bug bounty, by splitting like a morning and evening sessions,</div>
